# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategies – Capstone Project

This capstone project aims to predict customer churn for an Iranian telecom company and develop data-driven retention strategies. Using real-world telco data from UCI, the project applies machine learning models to uncover churn drivers and assist in proactive customer management.
